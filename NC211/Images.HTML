Since the release of the first movie in 2001, the "Fast and Furious" film series has become a cultural phenomenon. Box office receipts in the billions have transformed a niche LA street-racing movie into a mega-budget transcontinental heist franchise. The success looks set to continue, with "Furious 7" expected to rake in more than $100 million this weekend.

At the heart of the movies remain two constants — family and cars. We cover cars, so we've come up with a list of the 15 coolest cars from the movies. They aren't the flashiest or the most expensive, but they are active members of the cast and contribute to the storyline as much as their human counterparts. But we did favor cars driven by the main characters, as well as those with history and an automotive pedigree.
